				<h3> Personal Projects</h3>
					<h4>Turn based strategy game for AI research</h4>
							I created a chess like strategy game implementing some of the most
							distinct rules present across the many variations of chess found 
							across the world. The intention is to create a game where finding the 
							right move would be impossible by brute force algorithms running on 
							presently available hardware. 
							I intend to use this extensively in the future for AI research, and is
							a long term project. I'm still in the coding phase of the game, but I hope
							to have a version for alpha testing by the end of this year
