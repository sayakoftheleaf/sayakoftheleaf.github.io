		Sayak Chatterjee (a.k.a Rick) was born in Kolkata, India and graduated 
		from The Heritage School, Kolkata in 2014. While in high school, he found himself
		getting more and more passionate about Film and Computer Science at the same time.
		Since then, he has been attending Tufts University in MA trying to balance his passion
		for the machine and what the machine can capture. He is a part of a number of campus 
		based film-making and film discussion clubs and is also trying his hand at more technical
		side projects. <br>

		P.S: His name is deceiving and is actually pronounced as 'Shy-oak'
